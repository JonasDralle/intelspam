Intelspam
=========
A Fun-Script for Team Fortress 2

## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES ##
When you have the Inteligence in Team Fortress 2 Capture the Flag
you can take a Friend and annoy the other Players

## HOW TO INSTALL ##
Put the .cfg file in yout cfg folder
Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg

The .cfg contains the Script
when Ingame just write in the Developer Console
"exec autoexec.cfg" (without Quotation marks)

Then write "bind [KEY] dropspam" in the console
replace the [KEY] with a key from your keyboard
(for example P or O)


##  HOW TO USE IT ##
When you press the Button you've set up in "how to install"
you'll start dropping the Intel every time you get it,
this will make a annoying sound and will spam the kill feed!

You don't have to hold the Button, it toggles.
you will get notified in the upper left
corner if it's active or not.

	Please Keep in Mind that you could get kicked and
	temporarily banned from the Server
